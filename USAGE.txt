====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This is a cross-platform Qt-based service management tool similar to PHPStudy.
It supports both Windows and Linux platforms with a modern, flat design interface.

KEY FEATURES
-----------
1. Installation Wizard with configuration options
2. IP and Port configuration (defaults: 0.0.0.0:10833)
3. Port availability check with process name detection
4. Automatic startup on system boot
5. Service management (Start/Stop/Uninstall)
6. No administrator privileges required for installation
7. Modern flat-style UI

HOW TO USE
----------

FIRST RUN (Installation):
  - When you run the application for the first time, it will show the Installation Wizard
  - Configure IP address (default: 0.0.0.0)
  - Configure port (default: 10833)
  - The wizard will check if the port is available and show which process is using it if occupied
  - Choose whether to enable automatic startup
  - Complete the installation

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
  RedisInstall --help              Show help information
  RedisInstall --install           Force run installation wizard
  RedisInstall --service           Run as service (background mode)
  RedisInstall                     Run management interface (if already installed)

MANAGEMENT INTERFACE:
  After installation, you can:
  - Start/Stop the service
  - View service status in real-time
  - Modify IP address and port (requires service restart)
  - Uninstall the service

BUILDING THE PROJECT
-------------------

Windows:
  1. Open the project in Qt Creator
  2. Configure with Qt 6.5 or higher
  3. Build -> Build Project
  4. Run the executable

OR using CMake:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .

Linux:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

Files:
  - main.cpp              : Application entry point with mode selection
  - mainwindow.*          : Service management interface
  - installwizard.*       : Installation wizard interface
  - serviceconfig.*       : Configuration management (stored in system config folder)
  - servicemanager.*      : Cross-platform service installation/management
  - portchecker.*         : Port availability checker with process detection

Platform-Specific:
  Windows: Uses Windows Service API (SC_HANDLE)
  Linux:   Uses systemd service files

Configuration Location:
  Windows: %APPDATA%/RedisInstall/config.ini
  Linux:   ~/.config/RedisInstall/config.ini

NOTES
-----
- On Linux, service installation requires root privileges (sudo)
- On Windows, the tool attempts to bypass UAC for normal user installation
- Service configuration changes require service restart to take effect
- Port checker shows the process name and PID when a port is occupied
